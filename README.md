# AnkiJoy #

This is a simple Python plugin I wrote for [Anki](http://ichi2.net/anki/) to enable Joystick and Gamepad support under
Linux. It relies on [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/) which you already have installed if you run Anki, and
[pygame](http://www.pygame.org/) for game controller support. It can likely be made to work with a little bit of
tweaking on Windows and MacOS systems, but I am not pursuing this at this time.

With this plugin you can map any of the following actions to arbitrary buttons on your favorite game controller:

*   Answer 1
*   Answer 2
*   Answer 3
*   Answer 4
*   Answer Default
*   Answer Incorrect
*   Bury Card
*   Mark Card
*   Repeat Audio
*   Show Answer
*   Suspend Card
*   Undo

*Note: this plugin only works for Anki 1.x and has been largely superseded by [this
addon](http://tmbb.bitbucket.org/gamepad/index.html).*
