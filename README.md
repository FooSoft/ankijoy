# AnkiJoy #

AnkiJoy is a plugin for Anki (version 1.x only) which enables joystick and gamepad support in Linux via pygame. Due to
differences in the Python runtime environment, this plugin does not currently function in Windows. With the help of this
plugin, you can map buttons on your favorite game controller to preset actions in Anki.
